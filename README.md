# GS_AT
This repository contains codes for in-line holography muti-height Gerchberg-Saxton phase retrieval with automatic affine transform preprocessing. <br>
Follow the 'main_GSwithAT.m' code-file for full guide how to use this algorithm.

# Processing path
Firstly, each in-line hologram is reconstructed (propagated to the object plane), then 'AutoAffineTransform.m' function is applied to extract and match features between n-th and last reconstruction. Basing on these features, affine transforms (AT) are estimated and applied to the input holograms to correct the xy shift and magnification mismatch between holograms (gif below) <br> <br>

After this preprocessing step, Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) multi-height algorithm is performed to retrieve object phase with minimized twin image noise comparing to single-frame angular spectrum backpropagation (fig. below)  <br> <br>
